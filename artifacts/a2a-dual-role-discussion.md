# A2A Dual-Role Agent: Discussion and Directory Structure

## Question 1: Can an A2A compliant agent act both client and server role with exactly same code base?

### Answer:

Yes, an A2A-compliant agent can absolutely act as both client and server roles with the exact same codebase. This is one of the key architectural features of the A2A protocol.

According to the documentation provided, the A2A protocol explicitly supports this pattern:

### Key Evidence from the Documentation:

1. **Combined Implementations Pattern**:

   > "Combined Implementations merge client and server capabilities in a single agent, useful for agents that both provide services and coordinate with others. This pattern simplifies deployment for smaller systems while maintaining full protocol compliance. The agent can receive tasks as a server while delegating subtasks as a client."

2. **Peer-to-Peer Capability**:

   > "Any A2A server can act as a client to other servers, enabling hierarchical task delegation"

3. **Implementation Flexibility**:
   > "A2A-compliant agents have complete freedom in how they implement protocol components. There is no requirement to implement all roles in a single agent."

### How It Works in Practice:

An agent with a single codebase can:

- **As a Server**: Expose HTTP endpoints to receive tasks from other agents
- **As a Client**: Make HTTP requests to other A2A servers to delegate subtasks

This dual-role capability enables powerful patterns like:

- **Task Delegation Chains**: Agent A receives a task, processes part of it, then delegates subtasks to Agent B
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Each agent in a chain can both receive and delegate tasks
- **Dynamic Collaboration**: Agents can form ad-hoc networks where each participant can both provide and consume services

### Example Scenario:

A "Research Agent" could:

1. **Server Role**: Receive research requests from user-facing agents
2. **Client Role**: Delegate specific tasks to specialized agents (e.g., Web Search Agent, Data Analysis Agent)
3. **Server Role Again**: Compile results and return them to the original requester

All of this happens within the same codebase, with the agent switching between client and server behaviors based on the context of each interaction.

For more detailed implementation examples and patterns, you should refer to the official A2A documentation at https://a2aproject.github.io/A2A/latest/ and the sample implementations at https://github.com/a2aproject.

## Question 2: Do you have best practical directory structure of an a2a compliant agent which is able to act as both client and server?

### Answer:

Based on the A2A protocol architecture and best practices for Python projects, here's a recommended directory structure for an A2A-compliant agent that can act as both client and server:

[Practical A2A LangGraph Agent Project Structure](./practical-a2a-langgraph-agent-project-structure.md)

### Key Components Explained:

#### 1. **Core Agent Logic (`src/agent_name/core/`)**

This contains your LangGraph agent implementation, independent of A2A protocol concerns:

- `agent.py`: Your LangGraph graph definition and logic
- `state.py`: State schemas for your agent
- `tools.py`: Any tools/functions your agent uses
- `prompts.py`: System prompts and templates

#### 2. **Server Components (`src/agent_name/server/`)**

Implements the A2A server protocol:

- `app.py`: FastAPI/Starlette application setup
- `routes.py`: A2A endpoints (`/tasks/send`, `/tasks/sendSubscribe`, etc.)
- `executor.py`: Adapts LangGraph execution to A2A task lifecycle
- `agent_card.py`: Generates the agent card for discovery

#### 3. **Client Components (`src/agent_name/client/`)**

Implements A2A client capabilities:

- `client.py`: Main client class for interacting with other A2A agents
- `discovery.py`: Methods to discover and fetch agent cards
- `auth.py`: Handles various authentication schemes

#### 4. **Unified Entry Point (`src/agent_name/main.py`)**

Example structure:

```python
import asyncio
from .server.app import create_server
from .client.client import A2AClient
from .core.agent import create_agent

class UnifiedAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = create_agent()
        self.client = A2AClient()
        self.server = create_server(self.agent)

    async def run_as_server(self, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000):
        """Run the agent as an A2A server"""
        await self.server.serve(host, port)

    async def delegate_task(self, remote_agent_url, task):
        """Act as a client to delegate tasks"""
        return await self.client.send_task(remote_agent_url, task)
```

### Best Practices for Dual-Role Implementation:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep protocol implementation (A2A) separate from business logic (LangGraph agent)

2. **Shared Configuration**: Use `common/config.py` to manage settings that affect both client and server roles

3. **Async Throughout**: Use async/await patterns consistently for non-blocking operations

4. **Environment-Based Role Selection**: Use environment variables to configure which role(s) to activate:

   ```python
   # .env
   ENABLE_SERVER=true
   ENABLE_CLIENT=true
   SERVER_PORT=8000
   ```

5. **Dependency Injection**: Pass the core agent instance to both server and client components to enable task delegation during server processing

This structure allows you to:

- Run the agent as a pure server
- Run it as a pure client
- Run both roles simultaneously
- Easily test each component in isolation
- Scale different components independently

For implementation examples, check the official A2A repositories at https://github.com/a2aproject for reference implementations that demonstrate these patterns.
